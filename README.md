# Laura Sammons Web Development Portfolio

This portfolio site that will highlight my projects and interests, and showcase my skills to clients, employers, friends, and other developers.

  1. Using valid and semantic markup.
    a. HTML5/CSS w3c validator
    b. JavaScript lint
    c. Semantic markup for disabled users (tab-through, Aria rules for SPA's)
  2. This is a Single Page App (SPA). The portfolio items (projects) will be displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.
  3. Include an About page, a Contact page, and links to GitHub and LinkedIn.
  4. This site should showcase mobile-first design so that it is accessible from any device.
  5. The newest portfolio projects should be shown first on the page and include all technical details.

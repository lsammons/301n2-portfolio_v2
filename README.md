# Laura Sammons Web Development Portfolio 07

This portfolio site that will highlight my projects and interests, and showcase my skills to clients, employers, friends, and other developers.
  1. Using valid and semantic markup.
    a. HTML5/CSS w3c validator

  2. This is a Single Page App (SPA). The portfolio items (projects) will be displayed with a repeatable template, so that I can reuse it, and abstract out the details for individual projects.

  4. This site should showcase mobile-first design so that it is accessible from any device.
  5. The newest portfolio projects should be shown first on the page and include all technical details.
